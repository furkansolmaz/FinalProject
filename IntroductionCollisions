Transportation is one of the most significant thing in our lives and people use many cars, bicycle or any vehicles to go everywhere. 
People can crash with them because of many reason such as vehicle hits pedestrians or bicycle etc. This project includes all types of collisions. 
Collisions will display at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. 
For this reason it is important to classify that why vehicles hit the others or which reason is the top collision in the state 
because of fatality and serious injuries about collisons affects state and people.
So in this project I'm going to make a program which can classify vehicles crash with others.
