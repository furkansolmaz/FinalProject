Transportation is one of the most significant thing in our lives and people use many cars, bicycle or any vehicles to go everywhere. 
People can crash with them because of many reasons. This includes all types of collisions. 
Collisions will display at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. So it is important to detect that why many vehicles crash with others.
So in this project I'm going to make a program which can detect and reduce the rate the vehicles crash with others.
